talking to nodeMCU wirelessly coded over LUA script
Before uploading change the ssid and password in the code 
upload all the four LUA files to the ESP8266 or its corresponding development kit.
you can use any IDE (i used ESPlorer v0.2.0). After uploading the code , the Editor will show an IP address. Connect your phone to the same router as the nodeMCU is connected with. Log on the the ip address in your phone or using a serial wifi terminal(i used Bluetooth usb wifi terminal, can be found very easlily on google play store). Enter the ip address and port no i.e. 80, and start sending data to the nodeMCU.
